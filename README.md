# React Native FlatList Rendering Bug

This repository demonstrates a peculiar bug encountered while using FlatList in a React Native application. The issue is characterized by intermittent rendering failures, resulting in a blank screen or incomplete list display.  The root cause is not immediately obvious, and the problem's inconsistency makes debugging challenging.

## Bug Description

A FlatList component, designed to display a list of items, sometimes fails to render its contents correctly. The issue is not consistently reproducible and appears randomly, making it difficult to identify a specific trigger.  Sometimes a portion of the list is shown; at other times, the screen remains completely blank.  The provided code demonstrates the flawed component, and the solution branch offers a working fix.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the appropriate branch (main for the bug, solution for the fix).
3. Run the application using a React Native environment.
4. Observe the inconsistent rendering behavior of the FlatList.

## Potential Causes

The suspected cause relates to issues within the component's lifecycle, data updates, or potentially improper key assignment in the FlatList.
